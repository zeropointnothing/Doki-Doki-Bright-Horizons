# Doki-Doki-Bright-Horizons
A fan mod for Doki Doki Literature Club!

- I do not own any content used in this accept for a few assets I created myself. DDLC characters, backgrounds, music, sounds, etc all belong to the Team Salvato. -

## PLEASE NOTE!

Due to lack of a team (that actually cares, believe me I'm trying), DDBH may never be finished. I unfortunately do not have the artistic skills to make this mod more than a silly little basic mod.

While I know I could just use base game assets, that is not my vision for this. I want to do something more. But I simply cannot find anyone with the same spark I got.

So until these people can be found, DDBH will be on hiatus. If you are interested in helping me out with this, my discord is @zeropointnothing. I'd be extremely grateful.
